# REST API with Go Lang

This repository contains a REST API implemented in the Go programming language. It utilizes several packages to build a robust and efficient API, including `gorilla/mux`, `net/http`, `mongodb`, `fmt`, and `log`.

## Project Overview

The project is aimed at providing a simple and extensible REST API using Go. It showcases best practices for building RESTful services and interacting with a MongoDB database.

## Packages Used

- **gorilla/mux**: [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) is a powerful and flexible HTTP router for building Go web applications. It is used in this project to handle routing and request multiplexing.

- **net/http**: The standard library package `net/http` is fundamental for building HTTP servers and clients in Go. It's used to create HTTP servers for the REST API endpoints.

- **mongodb**: The `mongodb` package allows us to interact with a MongoDB database, making it possible to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **fmt**: The `fmt` package is part of the Go standard library and is used for formatting and printing messages. In this project, it may be used for logging and debugging.

- **log**: The `log` package is another standard library package used for logging and error reporting.
